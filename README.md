</p>
<p>
(U) A timeline of attacks can give your organization a great way of understanding the value of your organization’s data to cyber criminals, Threat Actors, and everything in between. 
</p>
<br />
<h2>Course of Action</h2>

(U) Understanding what the person or group that has breached your network will do next gives defenders a place to start, ensuring that countermeasures are implemented ahead of time. 
</p>
<br />
<h2>Intelligence Gaps</h2>

</p>
<p>
An analyst should never stop at “I don’t know,” but rather at “I performed x-action to address said intelligence gap."

</p>
Some sites, like the Vulnerability Management Tool Data Repository, will have information.
<br />
<h2>Tactics, Techniques & Procedures</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
With the deployment of AI to the general public, TTPs will expand exponentially; however, AI may be used to create a new database of TTPs based on TTPs identified as being created by AI.
</p>
<br />
<h2>Data Extracted</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
It should include any documents that were extracted, the location of where the documents were taken from, the computer and whose it was, the time and date, and the server, individual, and location to where the data was sent and how.
</p>
<br />
<h2>Tool Analysis</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Give an overview of the tools that the Advanced Persistent Threat is employing. 
</p>
<br />
<h2>Timeline Analysis</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Should include a graphic presentation (via PowerPoint or analyst notebook) of everything that occurred during the attack.
</p>
<br />
<h2>Target Analysis</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Start your research on a micro level and finish on a macro level. Clues to the identity of the attacker(s) may not be apparent solely by researching the targeted attack but may be found by researching beyond the target itself.
